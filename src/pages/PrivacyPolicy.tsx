          <p><strong>Modulo does not collect, store, or share any personal data.</strong><br/>

          <h2>2. How Modulo Works</h2>
          <p>To provide activity suggestions, Modulo analyzes your calendar and any additional input you
            provide <strong>locally on your device</strong>. This information is temporarily processed and sent securely
            to <strong>OpenAI's API</strong> to generate personalized suggestions. None of this data is stored by
            Modulo.</p>

          <p>Modulo uses the <strong>OpenAI API</strong> to generate suggestions. While we do not store or collect your
            information, your calendar summary and any inputs you choose to provide may be processed by OpenAI's
            servers. For more information about how OpenAI handles data, please refer to their <a
